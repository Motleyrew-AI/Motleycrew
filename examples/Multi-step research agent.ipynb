    "The idea is as follows: we start with a research question and some source of data we can retrieve from. We retrieve the data relevant for the original question, but then instead of feeding it into the LLM prompt to answer the question, like a conventional RAG would do, we use it to ask an LLM what further questions, based on the retrieved context, would be most useful to answer the original question. We then pick one of these to do retrieval on, and by repeating that process, build a tree of questions, each with attached context, which we store as a knowledge graph.\n",

    "When we decide we've done this for long enough (currently just a constraint on the number of nodes), we then walk back up the graph, first answering the leaf questions, then using these answers (along with the context retrieved for their parent question) to answer the parent question, etc. "

      "Question:  Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n",
      "Answer:  Arjuna killed Karna during their duel in the Mahabharata under complex circumstances influenced by divine interventions and curses. During the duel, Karna's chariot wheel got stuck in the mud, and as he attempted to free it, he was vulnerable. Karna, bound by a curse from his teacher Parashurama, forgot the mantra to invoke the powerful Brahmastra weapon at this critical moment. Additionally, Krishna, serving as Arjuna's charioteer, played a strategic role by lowering their chariot at a crucial moment earlier in the duel, causing a serpent-arrow aimed at Arjuna's head to miss its fatal mark. These factors, combined with the psychological impact of Krishna reminding Karna of his past dishonorable acts, left Karna disheartened and distracted. Consequently, Arjuna, abiding by the rules of warfare and with Krishna's guidance, seized the opportunity to strike Karna while he was defenseless, leading to Karna's death. This act was pivotal in the context of the ongoing conflict between the Pandavas and the Kauravas in the Mahabharata.\n",
