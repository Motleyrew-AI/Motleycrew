    "## Agents and tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Motleycrew provides thin wrappers for all the common agent frameworks: Langchain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, and Autogen (please let us know if you want any others added!).\n",
    "It also provides thin wrappers for Langchain and LlamaIndex tools, allowing you to use any of these tools with any of these agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motleycrew also supports **delegation**: you can simply give any agent as a tool to any other agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the wrappers for tools and agents implement the Runnable interface, so you can use them as-is in LCEL and Langgraph code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "An **output handler** is a special tool that the agent uses for submitting the final output instead of returning it raw. Besides defining a schema for the output, the output handler enables you to implement any validation logic inside it, including agent-based. If your agent returns invalid output, you can raise an exception that will be returned to the agent so that it can retry.\n",
    "\n",
    "See our usage examples with a [simple validator](examples/validating_agent_output.html) and an [advanced output handler with multiple fields](examples/advanced_output_handling.html).\n"

    "\n",
    "The other two key concepts in motleycrew are crew and tasks. The crew is the orchestrator for tasks, and must be passed to all tasks at creation; tasks can be connected into a DAG using the `>>` operator, for example `TaskA >> TaskB`. This means that `TaskB` will not be started before `TaskA` is complete, and will be given `TaskA`'s output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all tasks and their relationships have been set up, it all can be run via `crew.run()`, which returns a list of the executed `TaskUnits` (see below for details)."

    "`SimpleTask` is a basic implementation of the `Task` API. It only requires a crew, a description, and an agent. When it's executed, the description is combined with the output of any upstream tasks and passed on to the agent, and the agent's output is the tasks's output. "

    "The functionality so far is convenient, allowing us to mix all the popular agents and tools, but otherwise fairly vanilla, little different from, for example, the CrewAI semantics. Fortunately, the above introduction just scratched the surface of the motleycrew `Task` API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In motleycrew, a task is basically a set of rules describing how to perform actions. It provides a **worker** (e.g. an agent) and sets of input data called **task units**. This allows defining workflows of any complexity concisely using crew semantics. For a deeper dive, check out the page on [key concepts](key_concepts.html).\n",
